# sorted-array
The first nethod getIntegers takes in an integer value z which determines the size of the inputted array.
The Scanner import will then allow the user to imput 'z' numbers and add it to an array.

The second method Print array used the array from the first method as the parameter and is printed out as an array using Arrays.toString.
This method is then called into the first method which prints out the inputs as an array.

The third method SortIntegers again takes the array from the first method as the parameter and  uses Array.sort to order the array in ascending order,
which is then ordered in descending order uding Collections.reverse order.
This method is called into the first method which outputs the array in descending order.
